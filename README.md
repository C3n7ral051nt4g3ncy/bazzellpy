# Bazzell-py

Bazzell-py allows you to call IntelTechniques Search Tools as functions in your Python program.

Michael Bazzell's useful suite of OSINT tools are a great start for any investigation. I wanted to be able to call on these tools without having to re-paste code when working on more complex projects. I've made this library available so you can too.

If you like this library, feel free to buy me a coffee!
